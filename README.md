Hi!
These are my projects, coded using python. The Tim-tam notebook is a machine learning model used in Data Royale Competition 2024 created by me and my team back in October. I mainly contributed in making the model itself, while my teammates focused in EDA and feature engineering. There is also another notebook which is a machine learning model used in OLC created by me and my team.
The other one is a simple madlibs game using python, feel free to download and run it! (make sure that story.txt and story2.txt is in the same folder as the Madlibs_BeginnerProjects.py)
I am eager to learn more about python, C++, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Hope you enjoyed!
