Hi!
So basically this is my first "projects", it's a simple madlibs game that i made using python. (shout out to tech with tim for the tutorial)
I just have a basic understanding of python so nothing complicated since i never really used python outside of data science projects/competition on kaggle.
I am eager to learn more about python, C++, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Hope you enjoyed!
